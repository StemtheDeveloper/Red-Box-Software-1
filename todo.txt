We are building a Firebase Functions-based integration with DocuSeal for document signing. The project involves creating a series of functions to handle PDF templates, signer workflows, and embedding the signing UI. Below is a structured plan with prompts for each step.

🌐 1. Setup & Auth
Prompt:

“Use Node.js with Firebase Functions, integrate DocuSeal REST API. Create a callable HTTPS function createDocuSealSubmission that takes a PDF template (or HTML), signer emails and roles, calls DocuSeal’s create_submission_from_pdf endpoint with field tags, returns the form URL for embedding.”

💾 2. HTML-to-PDF Template Creation
Prompt:

“Write a Firebase Function createPdfTemplateFromHtml(html, name) using DocuSeal’s create_template_from_html API. Input: HTML string and template name; output: DocuSeal template ID. Include error handling and return status.”

🖋️ 3. Builder Embedding & Token Generation
Prompt:

“Implement a Firebase Function getBuilderToken that generates a signed JWT (using DocuSeal API key in env vars) for the DocuSeal form builder, returning builder_token. Use HS256 and include allowed document_urls, user_email, and name claim.”

📥 4. Client-Side Embed: Form Builder
Prompt:

“In your Firebase‑hosted website, write JavaScript to fetch /getBuilderToken and initialize embedded DocuSeal builder. E.g. <div id="builder"></div> and load the form builder inside it when the token is received.”

📤 5. Client‑Side Embed: Signing UI
Prompt:

“Given a DocuSeal form URL (e.g. in a submission_url field), write a React/Vue/vanilla JS component that embeds the signing form: uses <iframe src='...'>, passing signer email as query param.”

📧 6. Emailing Signer & Workflow
Prompt:

“Extend createDocuSealSubmission to optionally send email reminders via Firebase Scheduler. Use DocuSeal’s API: poll submission state, detect incomplete signers, then call their update_submitter or send manual reminders.”

🔗 7. Webhook Handling
Prompt:

“Create a Firebase HTTP endpoint /docuseal-webhook to receive DocuSeal webhooks on submission completion. Verify signature (if available), update Firestore document status, and store final signed PDF blob in Firebase Storage.”

📄 8. File Storage & Retrieval
Prompt:

“Write a function saveSignedDocument(submissionId) triggered after webhook. Calls get_submission_documents, downloads signed PDF(s), stores in Firebase Storage under signed/{submissionId}/, and updates metadata in Firestore.”

📦 9. Template Management UI
Prompt:

“Build a Firestore-backed UI for admins to upload new templates: upload PDF or HTML, optional field tag preview. On form submission, call createPdfTemplateFromHtml or upload pdf function and list available templates with IDs.”

🔒 10. Security & Secrets Handling
Prompt:

“Instruct Copilot to add Firebase Function middleware that checks for an authenticated user or admin via Firebase Auth before allowing access to builder-token or create-submission functions.”

⚙️ 11. Monitoring & Alerts
Prompt:

“Write a Firebase Monitoring script (cron or scheduled fun): periodically check submissions in ‘pending’ state older than X days via DocuSeal’s list_submissions, send Slack notifications for manual follow-up.”

🧪 12. Testing & Validation
Prompt:

“Generate unit tests (Jest) for the Firebase Functions: mocking DocuSeal endpoints to test create_submission_from_pdf, getBuilderToken, webhookHandler, and storage logic.”
