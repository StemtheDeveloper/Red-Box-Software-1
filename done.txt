‚úÖ COMPLETED TASKS

üåê 1. Setup & Auth - COMPLETED
Prompt:
"Use Node.js with Firebase Functions, integrate DocuSeal REST API. Create a callable HTTPS function createDocuSealSubmission that takes a PDF template (or HTML), signer emails and roles, calls DocuSeal's create_submission_from_pdf endpoint with field tags, returns the form URL for embedding."

Implementation: Created Firebase Functions with DocuSeal integration including createDocuSealSubmission function with proper error handling and field tag support.

üíæ 2. HTML-to-PDF Template Creation - COMPLETED
Prompt:
"Write a Firebase Function createPdfTemplateFromHtml(html, name) using DocuSeal's create_template_from_html API. Input: HTML string and template name; output: DocuSeal template ID. Include error handling and return status."

Implementation: Created createPdfTemplateFromHtml function that takes HTML content and template name, creates template via DocuSeal API, stores metadata in Firestore, and returns template ID with proper error handling.

üñãÔ∏è 3. Builder Embedding & Token Generation - COMPLETED
Prompt:
"Implement a Firebase Function getBuilderToken that generates a signed JWT (using DocuSeal API key in env vars) for the DocuSeal form builder, returning builder_token. Use HS256 and include allowed document_urls, user_email, and name claim."

Implementation: Created getBuilderToken function that generates signed JWT tokens using HS256 algorithm with user email, name, and allowed document URLs for secure form builder embedding.

üì• 4. Client-Side Embed: Form Builder - COMPLETED
Prompt:
"In your Firebase‚Äëhosted website, write JavaScript to fetch /getBuilderToken and initialize embedded DocuSeal builder. E.g. <div id="builder"></div> and load the form builder inside it when the token is received."

Implementation: Created DocuSealClient class with embedFormBuilder() method that fetches builder tokens from getBuilderToken function and embeds the DocuSeal form builder in iframe. Implemented in docuseal.html with working form builder tab.

üì§ 5. Client‚ÄëSide Embed: Signing UI - COMPLETED
Prompt:
"Given a DocuSeal form URL (e.g. in a submission_url field), write a React/Vue/vanilla JS component that embeds the signing form: uses <iframe src='...'>, passing signer email as query param."

Implementation: Created embedSigningForm() method in DocuSealClient that embeds signing forms using iframe with support for signer email query parameters and full responsive design.

üìß 6. Emailing Signer & Workflow - COMPLETED
Prompt:
"Extend createDocuSealSubmission to optionally send email reminders via Firebase Scheduler. Use DocuSeal's API: poll submission state, detect incomplete signers, then call their update_submitter or send manual reminders."

Implementation: Created emailReminderScheduler function that runs daily at 9 AM UTC, checks for pending submissions older than 2 days, polls DocuSeal API for incomplete signers, and sends automated reminders. Also added manual sendSubmissionReminder callable function and UI button for admins to send immediate reminders. Includes full error handling and Firestore tracking of reminder history.

üîó 7. Webhook Handling - COMPLETED
Prompt:
"Create a Firebase HTTP endpoint /docuseal-webhook to receive DocuSeal webhooks on submission completion. Verify signature (if available), update Firestore document status, and store final signed PDF blob in Firebase Storage."

Implementation: Created docusealWebhook endpoint that handles submission completion, expiration, and submitter completion events, updates Firestore status, and triggers document storage.

üìÑ 8. File Storage & Retrieval - COMPLETED
Prompt:
"Write a function saveSignedDocument(submissionId) triggered after webhook. Calls get_submission_documents, downloads signed PDF(s), stores in Firebase Storage under signed/{submissionId}/, and updates metadata in Firestore."

Implementation: Created saveSignedDocument function that downloads completed documents from DocuSeal, stores them in Firebase Storage with proper metadata, and updates Firestore with storage paths.

üì¶ 9. Template Management UI - COMPLETED
Prompt:
"Build a Firestore-backed UI for admins to upload new templates: upload PDF or HTML, optional field tag preview. On form submission, call createPdfTemplateFromHtml or upload pdf function and list available templates with IDs."

Implementation: Enhanced the docuseal.html templates tab with a comprehensive template creation form supporting HTML templates with field tags, form field management UI, template preview capabilities, and full integration with createPdfTemplateFromHtml function. Includes template listing, field type selection (text, signature, date, checkbox), and proper error handling. Templates are stored in Firestore with metadata and can be used directly in submission creation.

üîí 10. Security & Secrets Handling - COMPLETED
Prompt:
"Instruct Copilot to add Firebase Function middleware that checks for an authenticated user or admin via Firebase Auth before allowing access to builder-token or create-submission functions."

Implementation: Enhanced all Firebase Functions with comprehensive security measures including:
- Created verifyAuthentication() and verifyAdminAccess() middleware functions
- Added admin email verification for sensitive operations (createDocuSealSubmission, createPdfTemplateFromHtml, getBuilderToken, sendSubmissionReminder)
- Implemented rate limiting per user and function (20 submissions, 10 templates, 30 tokens, 10 reminders per minute)
- Added environment variable validation and API key security checks
- Enhanced webhook security with proper headers and data validation
- Added security headers middleware (X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, etc.)
- All functions now require admin authentication for access

‚öôÔ∏è 11. Monitoring & Alerts - COMPLETED
Prompt:
"Write a Firebase Monitoring script (cron or scheduled fun): periodically check submissions in 'pending' state older than X days via DocuSeal's list_submissions, send Slack notifications for manual follow-up."

Implementation: Created comprehensive monitoring system with:
- monitoringAndAlerts scheduled function running daily at 10 AM UTC
- Checks for stale submissions (7+ days pending) and submissions needing reminders (3+ days without reminders)
- Slack integration with webhook notifications for alerts and weekly summaries
- Detailed alert messages with submission details and recommended actions
- Error monitoring with automatic Slack notifications for system issues
- Manual monitoring trigger function (triggerMonitoringCheck) for immediate checks
- Monitoring dashboard tab in docuseal.html with configuration info
- Firestore storage of monitoring reports for historical tracking
- Rate limiting and admin authentication for manual triggers

üß™ 12. Testing & Validation - COMPLETED
Prompt:
"Generate unit tests (Jest) for the Firebase Functions: mocking DocuSeal endpoints to test create_submission_from_pdf, getBuilderToken, webhookHandler, and storage logic."

Implementation: Created comprehensive Jest-based test suite including:
- Added Jest, supertest, and firebase-functions-test to devDependencies
- Created jest.config.json with proper configuration for Firebase Functions testing
- Implemented test/setup.js with environment setup and service account mocking
- Created test/helpers.js with shared utilities for test authentication and request creation
- Developed test/docuseal.test.js with unit tests covering all major functions:
  * createDocuSealSubmission with field tags, authentication, and error handling
  * createPdfTemplateFromHtml with HTML processing and Firestore storage
  * getBuilderToken with JWT generation and validation
  * docusealWebhook with signature verification and event processing
  * saveSignedDocument with PDF download and Firebase Storage integration
  * sendSubmissionReminder with email workflows
  * monitoringAndAlerts with Slack integration
- Built test/integration.test.js for end-to-end workflow testing
- Added test/README.md with comprehensive documentation for running and extending tests
- All tests include proper mocking of external services (DocuSeal API, Firebase services, Slack)
- Coverage reporting configured with detailed HTML reports
- Test scripts added to package.json (test, test:watch, test:coverage)
