✅ SIMPLIFIED DOCUMENT SIGNING SYSTEM COMPLETED

## What was built:
1. **document-signing.html** - Clean step-by-step wizard for uploading and sending documents
2. **document-dashboard.html** - Dashboard for tracking sent/received documents  
3. **view-document.html** - Secure document viewer with access control
4. **Updated Firebase Functions** - Simplified backend for document management
5. **Navigation Updates** - Added new system to homepage and menus

## Core workflow implemented:
- Users upload PDF or create HTML documents
- Add multiple signers with email addresses
- System generates secure sharing links
- Signers get email notifications and can sign online
- All parties can track progress in dashboard
- Links are protected (only sender + signers can access)

## Key simplifications:
- Removed admin-only restrictions (any user can send docs)
- Streamlined from complex multi-tab interface to simple 3-step wizard
- Focused on core use case: upload → share → sign → download
- Enhanced security with token-based access control
- Mobile-responsive design throughout

The system now provides exactly what was requested: a simple way for users to upload documents, share them securely for signing, and track the process. Perfect for contracts, agreements, and any documents needing signatures.
